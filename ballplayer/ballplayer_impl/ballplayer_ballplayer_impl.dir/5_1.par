Pin Constraint Summary:
   35 out of 35 pins locked (100% locked).

WARNING - par: According to the connectivity, it is better to place PLL comp "pll_u2/PLLInst_0" on site "LPLL"; however, this site has been occupied or prohibited.
WARNING - par: According to the connectivity, it is better to place PLL comp "pll_u2/PLLInst_0" on site "LPLL"; however, this site has been occupied or prohibited.
WARNING - par: According to the connectivity, it is better to place PLL comp "pll_u2/PLLInst_0" on site "LPLL"; however, this site has been occupied or prohibited.
WARNING - par: RPLL must be put in reset state during background Flash programming. System design must take this into consideration when PLL is used during background Flash programming. Please see TN1204 MachXO2 Programming and Configuration Usage Guide for detailed information.
WARNING - par: PIO driver comp "clk" of PLL "pll_u2/PLLInst_0" CLKI input will be placed on a non-dedicated PIO site "C1/PL4A"; therefore, general routing has to be used.
The following 5 signals are selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    lcd1/clk_50MHz (driver: lcd1/pll_u1/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 170)
    clk_24MHz (driver: pll_u2/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 19)
    clk_c (driver: clk, clk load #: 114)
    jump/clk_out (driver: jump/fre_500us/SLICE_507, clk load #: 75)
    dat_valid (driver: u7/SLICE_1045, clk load #: 14)

WARNING - par: Signal "clk_c" is selected to use Primary clock resources. However, its driver comp "clk" is located at "C1", which is not a dedicated pin for connecting to Primary clock resources. General routing has to be used to route this signal, and it might suffer from excessive delay or skew.

The following 8 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    clk_c_enable_20 (driver: u7/SLICE_1045, clk load #: 27, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 1)
    n21688 (driver: adc_driver/SLICE_458, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 39, ce load #: 0)
    u8/count (driver: u8/SLICE_765, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 19)
    jump/n22446 (driver: jump/SLICE_955, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 13)
    jump/fre_500us/n10900 (driver: jump/SLICE_955, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 13, ce load #: 0)
    u7/clk_c_enable_121 (driver: u7/SLICE_985, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 13)
    lcd1/lcd_init_inst/cnt_150ms_22__N_1318 (driver: lcd1/lcd_init_inst/SLICE_656, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 12, ce load #: 0)
    u7/n10930 (driver: u7/SLICE_985, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 12, ce load #: 0)

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
